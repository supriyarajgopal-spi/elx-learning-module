Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II';;'"Who is it for?"
This weekly concentrated treatment is for any customer looking for extra care and an intensive boost of repair technologies and hydration. 

"What makes this PowerFoil Mask so innovative?"
This innovative PowerFoil mask features a unique double matrix design combining cotton with a foil backing which helps to drive this concentrated formula 25X faster and deep into skin.

"What is an analogy to explain what 25X faster means?"
To better understand what 25Xs faster means think of it like flying from New York to Hong Kong in just 40 minutes versus 16 hours.
 A flight from New York to Hong Kong is approximately 16 hours.
 Divide 960 minutes (16 hours) by 25 = 38 minutes. 
 So you could approximate that 25X faster is like flying from New York to Hong Kong in just 40 minutes!

"If I use the Concentrated Recovery PowerFoil Mask do I still apply Advanced Night Repair?"
No. On the nights when you use the PowerFoil Mask, you do not need to apply Advanced Night Repair. However, you should use Advanced Night Repair all other nights followed by your moisturizer.

"How do I use it?" 
Apply on clean skin, once a week at night. Remove mask, carefully unfold and apply bottom half first, then top half. Leave on for 10 minutes, then remove mask and gently massage any remaining liquid.

"Can I use it more than once a week?"
It is designed as a weekly treatment mask to jumpstart and renew the look of skin from the visible assaults caused by the environment and todays modern life. However, it can also be used anytime skin has been exposed to extreme conditions such as weather, travel, or stress as desired.

"Do I need this if I am a long term Advanced Night Repair user?"
Yes, this weekly concentrated high performance foil-backed recovery mask infuses skin with potent repair technologies 25X faster than a traditional sheet mask and a double dose of Hyaluronic Acid (compared to Advanced Night Repair) to help jumpstart and renew the look for the week ahead.  Instantly, skin looks fresher, more translucent and renewed.
 
"Is the Concentrated Recovery PowerFoil Mask a concentrated form of Advanced Night Repair?"
No. This weekly concentrated high performance foil-backed recovery mask is meant to be a complement to Advanced Night Repair to help reset and renew skin from the assaults of modern life for the week ahead. While it contains some of the potent repair technologies of Advanced Night Repair, it has its own unique benefits specific to the mask.

Eyes will instantly look transformedsmoother as lines and wrinkles are immediately filled. Over time, they look brighter, dark circles appear reduced, and eyes more lifted. ;'Firm Step 1 Apply by placing 3 dots underneath your eye and then pat gently to blend. You can be generous with how much you apply.

Fill Step 2  Apply only a pin-sized amount anywhere you see lines (Pro tip: smile to see exactly where they are.) Pat the creme into your skin using a rolling motion, working from the outer corner of the eye, in. Remember, a little goes a long wayuse sparingly! 

And get real with these tips:

 If your eye area is dry, you can apply Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum first for an extra boost of hydration.
 For best results, when applying your concealeruse a brush or a clean fingertip with a patting motion. This will help keep the filler in place.

No, it does not have the Skin Refinishers found in the New Dimension Shape + Fill Expert Serum, but it does feature the Shaping Technology. Skin is plumped with immediate, intensive moisture and helps brighten the look of the overall eye area.

"Why do we need two separate jars for the eye?"
New Dimension Firm + Fill Eye System is in two separate jars because its a 2-step eye treatment consisting of two unique formulas with distinct benefits. 
The first jar firmsthis ultra light, pillowy-gel gives an immediate tighter feeling while hydrating and firming the eye area. The second jar fillsthe expert creme filler firms and smoothes the eye area for a more contoured eye look. Together they transforminstantly, eyes look and feel smootheras lines and wrinkles are immediately filled in. Over time, dark circles appear reduced, eyes look firmer and more lifted, and more contoured. The look of crepiness and puffiness is diminished.  

"Do I need to use an additional eye creme with it?"
No, its not necessary. This 2-step expert eye treatment is all you need for a more hydrated, firmer, and more contoured eye area. However, if she wishes to layer an additional eye creme she can. In that case, we recommend applying Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum.

"Can I layer it with Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum?"
Yes. New Dimension Firm + Fill Eye System can be layered over Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum. If your customers eye area appears dry, apply Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum first for an extra boost of hydration and repair. Then apply New Dimension Firm + Fill Eye System following steps below.

"Can I apply concealer on top New Dimension Firm + Fill Eye System?"
Absolutely. We recommend when applying concealer on top to use a formula that has more slip like Double Wear Stay-in-Place Flawless Wear Concealer. When you apply, we recommend using a Concealer Brush then apply using a patting motion versus a sweeping motionyou dont want to move the Filler you just applied. If she would like to use her finger to apply her concealer, make sure she applies with a clean fingeryou do not want to use the finger you just applied the Filler with.

"Can I apply lip color on top of the treatment?"
Of course! Any lip color can be applied directly on top of the New Dimension treatment balm. However, if you are using a lip liner, we recommend applying the lip liner first, and then to apply the treatment balmbecause of its incredible hydration and the moisture it gives lips its harder to apply lip liner on top. Then, follow with your lip color. 

"What is the scent?"
The Expert Plumper is fragrance-free and the Expert Filler is a delicate blend of jasmine and rose.

"Why cant I use my New Dimension Shape + Fill Expert Serum on my neck?"
What additional benefits does the New Dimension Tighten + Tone Neck/Chest Treatment have?

The New Dimension Tighten + Tone Neck/Chest Treatment was specifically developed for the delicate neck and chest skin with a silky texture that easily spreads easily without any pulling or tugging.
 
It features the Shaping Technology and Pro-Collagen Complex first introduced with the New Dimension Shape + Fill Expert Serum, but also has specific benefits for the neck and chest like: reducing the appearance of horizontal neck lines and is extra comfortable and hydrating. In addition, it comes with a massage tool specifically developed for the neck/chest that helps to energize dull, dry skin and boosts microcirculation.

It is not recommended. The New Dimension Tighten + Tone Neck/Chest Treatment was specially formulated for the delicate skin on your neck and chest. This formula has extra slip and emolliency so it doesnt pull or tug on skin, especially as you apply with the innovative massage tool. That slip is not ideal/comfortable for facial skin. For facial skin, we recommend using New Dimension Shape + Fill Expert Serum and a custom-fit, targeted moisturizer for optimal benefits.

Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme';;'"Can customers use the brush to apply the mask?"
Noit is not recommended and it is very important that you explain this to every customer. The brush was intended to be applied to dry skin only. Using the brush to apply the mask will cause the brush bristles to discolor. In addition, if the customer cleans the brush by submerging it in water repeatedly over time, it will damage the brushsimilar to caring for any type of makeup brush. 

"What instructions should I give my customers about caring for the brush?"
Explain to the customer that the brush should be applied to dry skin only. Explain that the dry brush should be wiped with tissue after each use. Periodically she should cleanse the ends of the bristles with mild soap and water by gently swirling the tips in your palm. Next, swirl the brush againthis time in water onlyto remove any remaining soap. Do not submerge the brush in water. Air dry brush on its side. Allow to fully dry before reusing. 

"How do I clean the counter for demonstration purposes?"
After each use, spray tissue with hygienic spray. Lay tissue flat on a hard surface. Use gentle pressure, moving the brush in circular motions, to ensure only the ends of the bristles touch the tissue. Air dry brush on its side in an open environment, and allow to fully dry before reusing.

"Why is it called Mask Noir?"
Mask Noir translates to black mask referring to the striking jet-black color of the mask. 

"What makes the mask jet black?"  
The Bamboo Charcoal contributes to the striking jet-black color of the mask. This natural charcoal is known for its purifying and detoxifying powers.

"What makes this mask different from other masks on the market?"
Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Mask Noir is a luxurious, spa-like experience you can create at home. First, the exclusive, silky soft custom brush has a cashmere-like feel that creates an ultra pampering and invigorating experience for your skin. The brush, along with our custom massage technique, help increase skins microcirculation. 
Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Mask Noir is infused with a concentrated level of our precious Black Diamond extractto  help re-energize the look of skin. It is a multi-benefit formula that nourishes while helping to purify, detoxify and retexturize skin. With just one treatment, skin looks and feels transformed.                           

"What is special about the brush?"
This ultra-luxurious brush was carefully selected for its silky, cashmere-soft feel. The brush was also meticulously designed with an ultra-dense set of fibers for an extremely pampering and unique sensorial experience. 

This ritual was inspired by the ancient therapy of "dry brushing" which is adapted from a traditional body technique, now for the first time for face. 
This silky soft brush combined with the innovative massage helps increase microcirculation, re-energize skin''s appearance and preps skin for the mask that follows.  

"Can I use the brush without the mask to increase micro-circulation?"
Yes, but for the optimal experience we recommend using the brush followed by the mask. 

"What nutrient and minerals are in the mask?"
The nutrient-rich blend is infused with key minerals such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Zinc.

"How do I use it?"
Use once a week following steps below:

Step 1: Dry brush on clean skin.
Use the brush dry, directly on clean skin*.

Chin and Cheek 
Using small circulating motions, massage from chin, along jaw, to bottom of eartwice. Next, massage from sides of nose, across cheek to templetwice. Repeat on other side of the face. 

Tip to Temple
Sweep brush from tip of nose to forehead, then use the small circular motion to massage above eyebrow, moving toward temple. Do this twice, and then repeat on other side of face. 

Up and Over
In one continuous motion, sweep brush from tip of nose up and over eyebrow, down side of face and neck to collarbone. Repeat on other side. Wipe brush with tissue.  

*Important: For best results, the brush should only be used dry, directly on your skin. Never apply the mask with the brush as the massage effect will be diminished and bristles will become discolored.

Step 2: Apply Mask Noir.
Next use the golden spatula to scoop desired amount of the mask out of the jar. Applying with your fingertips, smooth a thin layer over your skin. Wait 5 minutes, and then with warm water, gently massage with your fingertips, using a small circular motion and moving from the center of the face toward the outer edge. Avoid eye area. 

Rinse with warm water, then use a cotton ball to sweep on Re-Nutriv Softening Lotion or preferred toning or treatment lotion. Follow with the rest of your Re-Nutriv skincare ritual.
